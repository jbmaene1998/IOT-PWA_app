# IOT-PWA_app

Welcome to my school project on GitHub! In this project, I have created an IoT device using Python, Raspberry Pi, and Firebase. This IoT device can help to automate various tasks and provide real-time data monitoring.

To create the IoT device, I used Raspberry Pi and Python to collect data from sensors and send it to Firebase. Firebase acts as a real-time database and makes it easier to store and retrieve data from the IoT device. I used Firebase Authentication to secure the data and provide access only to authorized users.

For the frontend, I created a Progressive Web App (PWA) using JavaScript. The PWA allows users to monitor the data collected by the IoT device from anywhere and at any time. The PWA is responsive and can be accessed on any device, making it easy to use and access data.

Overall, this project was an exciting learning experience for me as I got to learn about IoT, Python, Firebase, and PWAs. I hope you find this project informative and interesting. Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions.
